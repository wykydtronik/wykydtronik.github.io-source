Hello Universe! I am a photographer and web developer from Seattle WA. I mainly deal with  WordPress and DevOps. I never really tinker on Github, but this blog is my incentive to keep on working with it. I have a background in graphics design, multi-media production, internet marketing, blackhat/whitehat/greyhat SEO, Linux, and AWS.

Right now I am focusing on learning Javascript which will be a great addition to my webdev skill sets. I'd like to spend more time combining Javascript/jQuery skills with PHP/MySQL. I think it's time for me to create a few personal projects with Github.
