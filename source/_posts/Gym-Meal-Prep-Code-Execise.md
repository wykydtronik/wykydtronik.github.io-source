These evening I spent a good 60 minutes on cardio. After the gym decided I needed go head to the grocery store and pick up ingredients and tupperware to try out meal prep. I spent about 2 hours cooking meals for the week and realized it was getting very late. Luckily earlier today I spent time blogging and tinkering with WordPress. At the gym, I did watch a few videos on Coursera and caught a few videos from Simple Programmer.

I think I may just kick back and thumb through my Javascript book and save experimental coding for tomorrow morning. I'm really happy to be on a good path with Javascript!
