Ive revisted Octopress on and off the past year in hopes to actually get a nice github pages blog going. Everytime Im faced with a few difficult challenges: SSD fails and losing the source, not having source branch on github (lack of guidance for this in the documentation), confusing differences between Octopress 2.0, 3.0, and Jekyll. Yesterday it seems that I kept running into more and more issues with Octopress 2.0 - it seems like everything I was doing had dependency errors. I would go and resolve the errors and new errors would surface. I gave up on Octopress 2 to try Octopress 3.0. Again, lack of documentation made it difficult to get rolling. No theme, no guidance to get the theme going, I started hacking together Jekyll themes to work on Octopress 3. The one thing I wanted to try kept giving me errors on octopress generate.

Finally after digging through the issues tracker I found a user that felt just as frustrated as myself, he/she decided to go with Hexo blogging framework. I check out their profile and was impressed with their github pages blog. I managed to get hexo going in 15 minutes with an interesting theme. This is the first time I've ever played with Node.js - and Im on Windows! Horray!

Now that this is rolling, Ill try to put the source onto my desktop (as oppose to my laptop) and go through the motions of breaking it on git.
