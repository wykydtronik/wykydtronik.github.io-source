A great thing about playing with a local sandbox repository and keeping this blog updated daily is I can keep track of how often I'm committing to my profile. 18 days in a row, I've spent a minimum of 1 hour playing with JavaScript. I would say I'm progressing slowly, however I can say I've completed all 4 Weeks of the JavaScript lessons on Coursera.

I'm at Starbucks right now, and since I no longer have a curriculum to work through I can finally sit down and read through more chapters of my JS book. I think how I'm going to do this is use directories for specific types of examples per chapter and reference W3Cschools for better understanding.
