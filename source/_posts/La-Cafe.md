It's the end of the week, time for a peaceful afternoon at the local cafe. It seems fairly busy today, probably because it's not raining in Seattle. I've obtained an eBook version of Javascript & jQuery so that I don't have to lug around a 15lb book (probability says it has a high chance of slipping out of my hands and knocking off an innocent coffee aficionado). I just realized that the ridiculously big typography of the book is great for a fablet screen.

The gf and I were talking about how we should both each buy Nintendo Switches, so that when we go hang out at the local cafe we can throw a LAN Party between the two of us as the local Amazonians scoff at us for taking up bandwidth.
