Back on the Pokemon Go grind! It's been a while but the past couple weeks I've been checking Pokemon Go and picking up a few of the newer Pokemon. The app has greatly improved since I last played it (I believe last November?). I can't wait for the spring weather to kick in for more walking / biking action. My favorite coffee spot has a pokestop next to it!
