This week has been a fun one in terms of tinkering with AWS and learning a few awesome tools for the platform. Unfortunately, I feel like I haven't progressed much on JavaScript. I just finished Chapter 4, and I'm reading through the DOM chapter. Daylight savings "spring forward" has really messed up my internal clock. I am still locked in to the same time schedule, so the time shift has really messed up my sleeping schedule. My evenings have shifted from very productive to 1-3 hour naps, due to lack of sleep (going to bed at 2am when my body thinks its 1am, waking up to sunrise around 7am). I should really buckle down and fix my sleep schedule.

This weekend, I'll probably be on the road most the weekend. Visiting family and running errands. I'll probably have time to sneak in a few photo ops and find a hole in the wall coffee shop. Well let's be honest, there's a Starbucks on every corner...
