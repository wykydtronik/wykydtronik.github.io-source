This weekend has been a busy one spent with good friends, hanging around the car scene, and watching Logan! Saturday for the most part was spent dwelling at home and getting much needed R&R. Sunday kicked off with a car meet, despite waking up to hail / snow the weather cleared up for a few hours. Most of my afternoon was spent exploring Seattle and playing with photography. Later that evening, I went to see Logan and man I'd highly recommend going to see it.
