I'm really happy that I'm getting close to half way through the JavaScript book. It's been slow progress, but I'm trying to step up the tempo. My goal is to not lose focus on this book, finish it front to back, then move onto picking up another book similar but more advanced. Perhaps Eloquent JavaScript, as my buddy Tyler has suggested. I've also thought about brushing up on my PHP by skimming through a few chapters. I've also thought about building a WordPress theme from scratch, and building a website based on a framework like AngularJS or Node.JS? We shall see...
