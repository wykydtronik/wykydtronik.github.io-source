This weekend was a tough one. Earlier in the week I turned my PC into a Hackintosh. I spent a few days messing with the drivers trying to get it to run stable and had to reinstall a few different times while running into choppy UI issues. It turns out my Corsair H100i V2 water pump died, second time this has happened. I'm going to try to get it RMA'd through Corsair this coming week. The issues I was having with macOS was a combination of bad disk partitions and not being aware that my proc was being throttled heavily when the temps reached above 97c. I popped an OEM heat sink in and my case looks empty... Maybe it's time to go with a custom loop...

Saturday shooting at the track. Spent 9-10 hours running around on foot with 4 hours of sleep. That was a rough day. I'm now working on getting Lightroom setup and transferring my catalog over from my Windows NTSF disk.

In the coming days I'll have to setup AWS CLI, local development environments, databases, and project repositories. I've neglected my JavaScript book in the past 3 days and I need to make up for that. I also received PHP Advanced and Object-Oriented Programming by Larry Ulman. I'll be reading that after I finish with my JavaScript book. I'd like to also skim through Eloquent JavaScript and Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja. I'll also need to figure out which JS framework I should start playing with, I'm leaning towards REACT but I'm hesitant because... well it's FB...
