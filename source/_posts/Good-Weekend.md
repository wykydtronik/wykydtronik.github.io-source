I had a great weekend, spent a good amount of time in Seattle. I got to spend quality time tinkering with git and hexo, setting up a local instance, etc. I also spent time brushing up on other Javascript related basics, specifically looking at DOM related features. I'm breezing through the basics just as an exercise.
