Heading to Boston MA this Monday, leaving my house at about 5am for an early flight. There will be a 2 hour layover and I'm not looking forward to it! Flying is very exciting, I do enjoy flying across country. The downside is ending up in a strange place with to many unknowns, such as public transportation.

Next week I'm heading to the Boston headquarters of Mendix to do Advance Training for the Mendix app platform. My employer is looking to build an internal app for the corporation. Since I'm dedicating more time towards keeping an up-to-date blog with github pages, I'll try to take notes from the Advance Training and post them here.
