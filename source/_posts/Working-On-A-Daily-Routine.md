Lately I've been really trying to work on a daily routine, where I can really set higher standards for myself and make it the norm.

Obviously, my work takes up most of my time throughout the day. I try to keep on top of things with use of my Moleskin Weekly Notebook. I keep this book at my desk, specifically for day to day tasks that needs to be addressed and worked on. I fill it with todo's and daily reminders.

Right now, I'm not using any fancy apps asides using Google Reminders or Kitchen Timer. Google Reminders are for quick and simple reminders. I specifically use Kitchen Timer to track time blocks shorter than an hour, like 15 - 30 minutes. Aside from those two Android apps, I also relay heavily on SimpleNote to keep notes stored on the cloud. All of those digital notes are accessible on any computer with internet and on my Android devices.

I feel like I'm going to start focusing on creating activity blocks throughout my day to focus on specific tasks, such as household tasks, maintenance, debugging, escalated tickets, documentation, etc.

Outside of work, I have a few things that I really want to keep on the daily routine. One of which is committing at least an hour at the gym. The gym mostly consists of cardio workouts, as I do love watching YouTube and Coursera on the elliptical and/or treadmill. Then there is weights, specific muscle groups, etc. And if the basketball court is free, practice my free throw and layups. With the weather as shitty as it has been, BMX and Skateboarding is out of the picture until it drys up and warms up at least above 40 degrees...

When I get back home from the gym, I have time for R&R. I may play a few matches of CSGO or put an hour or so into Fallout 4. I am trying to minimize my gaming right now and trade that off for focusing on this blog, git, and Javascript. I've mentioned it before, HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL is great and all... But one of my biggest draw backs, including UI, is not having good experience with Javascript and jQuery. I'm determined to keep experimenting with all of this to get a better understanding of the DOM.

This would be my regular Monday through Friday routine. I doubt I'll have time to deal with urban exploration and photography... Seattle's traffic is a nightmare at times, so traveling around the city can be a headache. My weekends are usually wide open for photography.

When I have time, I think I'll make a list of bullet points of daily vs weekly items. I might include chores since I'll be getting a new roommate soon.
