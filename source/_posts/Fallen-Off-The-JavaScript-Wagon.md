This past 4-5 days of dealing with the Hackintosh has seriously derailed my JavaScript quest. I am really slacking on this and need to get back on the horse and continue this adventure. I've also had to review all the photos I took from Saturday and get a set sent over to a colleague for marketing purposes. I will pick up where I left off last week real soon.
