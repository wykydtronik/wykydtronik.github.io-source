Well, it's been far to long since I've played with Hexo. I've been through a few different formats on my OS drive and struggled to recover the source code. Apparently I completely forgot how to restore my source from Git repository. From what I was looking at, it looked like the source on git was out of date. Thankfully I had the repo cloned on my laptop. I was able to restore it on my desktop without a hitch.

Since it's been so long, I'll have to figure out how to redeploy this after generating.
