Today the weather seems to be decent, partially cloudy mostly overcast. I'll more than likely be heading to Bellingham for the day to spend time enjoying the mild spring weather. I'll probably take my camera with me to take photos along the way. While I'm on the road, I think I'll start grinding away at jQuery. I started playing with it lightly last night. Bellingham is a couple hours away, so I have time to kill.
