An interesting turn of events... While I was working on cleaning up my "Backing Up Hexo Blog Source To Github Repo" blog post, my power went out! I was trying to figure out how I could get internet working on my laptop without power. I revisited FoxFi/Pdanet and discovered that FoxFi works fine with my locked down AT&T LG V10! I decided to pay for the pro-version, since I do love having LTE on my old 2010 laptop.

I was hesitent to tinker around with Hexo, because I was worried about getting merge conflicts when my power comes back on. Well, I decided to just create a new blog post. I can work on the github post when power comes on.
