I'm starting to take a liking to listening/watching to Coursera videos while at the gym, although it's challenging when they start talk about specifics in code and I have to slow down, pick up my phone, and squint at the screen to read the code. I really wish I had a tablet with 4GLTE or a tablet connected to my phone's hotspot. Wouldn't that be nice?
