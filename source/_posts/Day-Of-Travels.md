Traveling is always an exciting and scary experience, personally I hate having to spend 8 hours traveling to the east coast. I have a 2 hour lay over in Minneapolis. I've been awake since 2am because I went to sleep fairly early last night after Easter dinner with the fam. 2 more hours until take off at Sea-Tac, just killing time by tweeting and blogging.

I think I should buy a neck pillow for napping on the plane. That will 
probably rekt my sleep pattern, as if it wasn't already rekt.
