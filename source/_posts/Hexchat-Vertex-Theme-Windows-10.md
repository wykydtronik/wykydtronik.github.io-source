Today I was exploring other IRC clients for Windows because frankly IRC clients on Windows look like relics of ancient past. One of my all time favorite IRC clients hands down goes to Textual, an OSX based application. Unfortunately I don't have the luxury of blowing 2 grand on a Macbook Bro. I can hardly fathom dropping $1200 on a peasant book air. All bashing aside, I actually love OSX it's just the hardware that makes my wallet cringe...

While I was checking out IRC clients, I decided to scoup out how active Hexchat's Github repository was. A very lively community, I thought damn I'm glad Hexchat was still alive and well. I happened to click into the Issue tracker and noticed a few people arguing about how the mIRC theme needs to actually look like the mIRC client. Hold the phone! Hexchat has THEMES?

Indeed it does, I jumped into the documentation and found Vertex. I fell in love with Vertex!

After setting Hexchat's gtk2 theme, I had a white title bar across the top of the window (see above image) it was blinding me in my dark dingy den. I had to figure out a way to fix this. Thankfully, [HowToGeek provides documentation on how to fix that!](http://www.howtogeek.com/222831/how-to-get-colored-window-title-bars-on-windows-10-instead-of-white/)
