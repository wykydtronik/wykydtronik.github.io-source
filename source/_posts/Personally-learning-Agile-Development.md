The past 2 months I've been working on and off with a team to work on an internal enterprise application. While we've been working on the project, I've been schooled on how Agile Development works from the developers perspective. I am glad that our team has taken on a few Senior Developers and a strong scrum master. There's more structure to keep the development marching forward.

One thing I've really relied on for retrospective meetings is pulling up my commit history from the project. I've also keep a notebook at my workstation to jot down notes on tasks I'm working on, which is great to reference during stand up meetings and retrospectives. Often times it's hard to improvise off the top of your head when you have to think back to the day before or reflect on the entire week. Referencing my own commit history also helps for code reviews, especially if there's a ton of intricate work that's been worked on.

Working with Agile Development has also strengthened my understanding of Version Control and the need for it. In the past, my teams have always been 1-2 people and maybe a 3rd tossing in UI updates. It was never to complex in terms of team composition.
