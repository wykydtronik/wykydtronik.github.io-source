I'm at the point where I am not 100% where to go for more resources asides W3C and continuing to grind through my JavaScript book. I have occasionally searched for YouTube videos on more advanced topics. LearnWebCode definitely caught my eye with his explanation of OOP in JavaScript, it really rekindled what I learned from PHP and got my noodle buzzing. I'm really starting to enjoy coding in my free time as part of my daily exercises. Just so that I don't lose focus, my number one priority is to get through the JS book front to back before taking a step into a side project. I think my side project will be a custom WordPress theme that I can maintain on github.

Below is another hour long video from Derek Banas that I really enjoyed (the first 20 minutes) at the gym. I decided to put it on my Watch Later list specifically because I'd like to sit down and code along with him. He does get a little nitty gritty and is fast paced, so coding along with him will probably help connect the dots. Having the ability to pause and think is also a plus side too.

Another video I really enjoyed was actually a talk from Anjana Vakil which was held at JSUnconf 2016 about "Learning Functional Programming with JS" - this one really hit the feels and made me miss attending WordCamps. I really need to get back into attending local conferences and even setting aside money to attend conferences down in San Fran.

## Jackpot Find
I also spotted a goldmine of a resource I found on Ycombinator - [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) - literally an outline of all books and online lectures you can sponge out on. I'm actually considering spending the time and obtaining these books. Also check out the [comments thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13862284) for more insightful commentary on this site.

I will occasionally post more interesting resources I find and tag them accordingly.
