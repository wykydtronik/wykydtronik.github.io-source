I don't know what to do, and where to head. Javascript isn't necessarily a specialty skill that I necessarily need. I guess I do enjoy building custom UI. I've always had a knack for front end design, starting with HTML, then onto CSS, then to PHP to build custom WordPress themes and plugins. I miss experimenting with webpages and building content to drive traffic to it. Javascript was always one of those languages that I've avoided, and I think I need to continue to push myself towards getting deeply involved with it.
