It’s been a while since I’ve been out and about at a coffee shop. I realized that my local repository seemed to be borked. I went ahead and backed up my config.yml file and pulled the hexo source down. I’m hoping I don’t accidentally break things.

I ran into a few little issues with the .git and config.yml, but I think I have it fixed.
