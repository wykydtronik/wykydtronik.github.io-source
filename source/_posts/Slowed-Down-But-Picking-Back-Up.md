I've been treading lightly in Chapter 7 of the JS book. I spent a little bit of free time playing with JS to get social buttons working on my WordPress blog. I am thinking about turning the code into a simple plugin for WordPress. I did this because most social share plugins want you to pay money for the feature I wanted.

jQuery is really making my pinking and ring finger do dancing. I need to get use to all the brackets that I need to throw at it to get the code written out and functional.

Also, outside of the custom social share functionality and jQuery chapter I've been helping the dev with cli-tweet. I wanted a means to tweet from the command line while I have it open working with git. Apparently my use case was untested (Windows) and .tweet.json was being written to the Program Files directory. If you attempt to install cli-tweet with a terminal that isn't escalated to Admin - it will error out. The dev fixed the issue and I tested the windows-support branch on my desktop, laptop, VM, and macOS.
