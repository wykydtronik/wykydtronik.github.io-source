Well, I completed Interactivity with Javascript by University of Michigan. Great introductory course on JavaScipt, it definitely left me hanging after Week 4. It felt fairly short, mostly educated you on how to use the DOM and understanding the basics. I am wondering if I should look into trying out other online courses like CodeAvengers.com - which seems to contain a lot more materials for online classes, including creating games in Javascript and also basic computer science courses. I really do enjoy these online courses, and I will still continue to chop away at my books.
