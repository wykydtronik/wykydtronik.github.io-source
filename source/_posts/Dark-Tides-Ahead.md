I don't know if this is the end, but it seems like a very grim and dark storm is heading inland. I am putting my head down at stepping major projects, I might rekindle them later in the Spring but for now I can't stand to keep going. I spent so much time building these projects to inspire someone very close to me. It's hard to do photography as a hobby and not have the drive. I built it for her, now it's gone.
