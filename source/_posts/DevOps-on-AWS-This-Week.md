This week has been a busy week for me working on AWS instances. I've picked up a few tools as a few issues have arisen on a few AWS instances I've been working on.

First issue that came up was a few bad queries that were hogging up system resources. I managed to recognize the queries that were causing the server to melt down and curtail the issue.

Outside of that, I've been looking at preventing brute forcers from hammering any forms on the web app. I reconfigured mod_security and implemented a few rules that will help curb the issue. I've also implemented a few features that will help prevent bots from hitting the forms, but obviously we still have zombies knocking on the door.

Yesterday evening, I didn't get a chance to play with JavaScript. However, I did watch a few JS videos on YouTube I found to be very informative. Below are a few great videos.
