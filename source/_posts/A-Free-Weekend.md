Today I have a open schedule, I am not entirely sure what to do today aside from play a little bit of Fallout 4 and sit down and thumb through my Javascript code. I may not head out to a coffee shop until later today when things wind down. As a previously mentioned, I'm not a fan of over populated coffee shops with wifi dwellers hunch over their Americano as they look over each others shoulders for the next available outlet. Yesterday I finished the Week 3 exam of Javascript Coursera, it's actually a lot of fun.
