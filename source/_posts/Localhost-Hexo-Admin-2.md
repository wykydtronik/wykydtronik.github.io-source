Trying out Hexo Admin on localhost. Since I have my _config.yml stored in my github repo, I don't think placing hexo-admin onto github pages will be smart... heh. I really like this UI for editing in browser.

## Update: Issue with Hexo Deployer Git

I just realized that the deploy feature on hexo-admin made my localhost admin panel explode. It's not properly configured and the dev hasn't provided any information on how to set that up. I think since I'm using hexo-deployer-git that it's a little bit more complicated that editing a file and clicking a button. I guess for now if I want to get pretty I can just use $ hexo server -d and make edits while seeing the visual representation on the right. I might not actually use this after all... Atom.io is a fun editor...
