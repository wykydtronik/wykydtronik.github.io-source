Since I've been very busy with work the past month, I've fallen behind on studying up on Javascript. It's been a while since I've worked with Javascript and I've been working on brushing up on the language. Right now I'm just playing with Codecademy, watching Coursera courses, and reading through "Javascript & Jquery" by Jon Duckett. Going from start to finish as a brush up kind of sucks, but Javascript was never my favorite language to play with. This adventure should be a fun one.
