I finished the jQuery Chapter over the weekend, it was slow going. Definitely not a fun chapter but I got the hang of various jQuery methods. While I was putting around the end of the chapter, I picked up on a few WordPress projects. I threw together my small social share plugin. I also found a new theme for my WP blog to work on. The dev seems to have been inactive, so I may fork his repository to continue it. I found a minor UI bug that I patched up and submitted to him. I'll continue to try to reach out to him and hope he updates his git repo, which is out of sync from the WordPress SVN repo.
