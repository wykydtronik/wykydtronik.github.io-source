I just discovered that a local Starbucks is quite dead in the evenings. It kind of looks ravaged, like they were super busy this afternoon. It does seem insanely busy during the mornings and afternoons. According to Google Maps, their business at this location falls flat on its face after 4pm... This is great! Time to give them a reason to stay open until 10pm!
