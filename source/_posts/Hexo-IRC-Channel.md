I noticed that Hexo is lacking an IRC channel. I've taken the liberty to park myself in the #Hexo IRC channel. In the past I've idled in the #OctoPress channel, but since that community seems to be dying down. I'm hoping that Hexo gains more momentum as this seems like a very fun practice to get your feet wet with version control and basic coding.

Methods of connecting to the IRC channel, simply register and use [IRCCloud.com](http://irccloud.com) - if you want a native client, [Hexchat](https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html) is another great IRC client and is also available on [Github!](https://github.com/hexchat)
