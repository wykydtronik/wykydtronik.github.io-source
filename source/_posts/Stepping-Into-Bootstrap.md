This week I've been taking on more UI/UX work by my employer for an internal app we're developing. The new platform we're working with uses Twitter Bootstrap, an interest topic I've tinkered around with on several WordPress projects. I'm currently using Scout as my SASS compiler, so far all the custom work has been easy going. Most of the heavy lifting is being done by the back end developers and I've been stepping in to improve any inconsistencies and clutter.
