Recently, I noticed the discover page on my Instagram is featuring programmer's photos. Most of the photos are examples of minimalist work stations, anything ranging from a Macbook with a few accessories upwards to 3 screens blanketed with code. Since this is a thing, I guess I can attempt to take unique photos of my own setup. The one thing I don't have is a knack for art latte's and a Macbook... I have an extremely outdated 2010 Intel i3 laptop and no good coffee shops around me.

Check out the IG [@programmerrepublic](http://instagram.com/programmerrepublic) for examples.
