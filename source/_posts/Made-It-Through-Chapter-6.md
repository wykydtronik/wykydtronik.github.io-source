Made it through Chapter 6, experimented with various ways of using events. It's been so long since I've played with JavaScript and I had no idea that using HTML DOM Events were considered bad practice. Working with addEventListener and attachEvent was a new to me. Actually, before this chapter I was using HTML DOM Events to use functions, like onmouseover and onclick. In the book, they also briefly talk about IE8 support... You have to pay attention to that because it's used throughout the whole chapter.... Book was publish on 2014... What mental grandma is rocking Windows XP and IE8? Or outdated corporate infrastructure? I'm sure it still exists... I've hit the half way mark of my book! Now onto the jQuery chapter!
